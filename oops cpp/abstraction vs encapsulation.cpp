//! Differences Between Encapsulation and Abstraction
//*Feature  


//Focus	                
//^ Encapsulation ==>            Bundling data and methods together; controlling access to internal data.	
//~ Abstraction ==>              Hiding the complex implementation details; exposing only essential features.

//How It's Achieved
//^ Encapsulation  ==>           	Using classes with access specifiers (private, protected, public).	
//~ Abstaction ==                Using abstract classes and pure virtual functions (interfaces).

//Purpose
//^ Encapsulation ==> 	Protecting object state and ensuring data integrity.
//~ Abstaction ==>   	Simplifying the interaction with complex systems.

//Example in C++
//^ Encapsulation ==>	A class that encapsulates data members and provides public methods to interact with them.
//~ Abstraction ==>  	An abstract class (or interface) that declares functions without specifying how they work.

// Real-World Analogy	
//^ Encapsulation ==>  A capsule that contains ingredients (data) and has a protective shell (access control).	
//~ Abstraction ==>    A TV remote that provides a simple interface (buttons) without exposing the inner workings of the TV.

// Conclusion
//^ Encapsulation is all about data hiding and bundling. It protects the internal state of an object and provides a controlled interface for interaction.
//~ Abstraction is about hiding complexity. It exposes only the necessary parts of an object or system, allowing users to work with it at a higher level without needing to understand the details.
