//! Is javascript a statically typed or a dynamically typed language

// & JavaScript is a dynamically typed language. In a dynamically typed language, the type of a variable is checked during run-time in contrast to a statically typed language, where the type of a variable is checked during compile-time.

//* example of static type
string name 
name = "tom"
name = 23 // !  its not possible to do that 


//* example of dynamic type
const name2 
name2 = "tom"
name2 = 23 // !  its  possible to do that 


//&  Since javascript is a loosely(dynamically) typed language, variables in JS are not associated with any type. A variable can hold the value of any data type.
