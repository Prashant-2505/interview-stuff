//! what is benfifit of using external javascript


    // Using external JavaScript has several benefits for web development.Here are some of the key advantages:

    // Separation of Concerns: External JavaScript allows you to separate your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code into different files.This promotes a cleaner and more organized code structure, making it easier to manage and maintain your codebase.

    // Code Reusability: When you place your JavaScript code in an external file, you can reuse the same code across multiple web pages.This reduces duplication and ensures consistency throughout your website.

    // Caching: External JavaScript files can be cached by the browser.When a user visits multiple pages of your site, if the JavaScript file is the same, the browser doesn't need to download it again, improving page load times and reducing bandwidth usage.

    // Faster Page Loading: Placing your JavaScript in an external file allows the browser to load and cache the script separately from the HTML content.This can lead to faster initial page loading since the browser can continue rendering the page while fetching and executing the JavaScript in the background.

    // Maintenance and Updates: If you need to make changes to your JavaScript functionality, you only need to update the external file.This change will then be reflected across all pages that reference that file.This is especially useful for bug fixes or feature enhancements.

    // Cleaner HTML Markup: Keeping JavaScript code external keeps your HTML markup cleaner and more focused on the structure and content of the page, rather than mixing it with behavior and interactivity.

    // Collaboration: When working with a team, separating JavaScript into external files can make collaboration more efficient.Different team members can work on different parts of the codebase without interfering with each other's work.

    // Better Code Management: External JavaScript files can be managed using version control systems(e.g., Git), making it easier to track changes, collaborate, and roll back to previous versions if needed.

    // Content Delivery Networks(CDNs): Many popular libraries and frameworks, such as jQuery and Bootstrap, are often hosted on CDNs.By using external scripts from CDNs, you can take advantage of their global distribution networks, potentially leading to faster script loading times for users around the world.

    // Reduced Server Load: When the browser fetches external scripts from their respective sources, it reduces the load on your own server, allowing it to focus on delivering the core content of your website.

    // Overall, using external JavaScript enhances code organization, promotes reusability, improves page loading performance, and simplifies maintenance, making it a recommended practice in modern web development.
